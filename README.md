# diabetes-prediction-clustering

This project was developed as part of **CS105: Data Analysis Methods** at the University of California, Riverside.
The goal was to predict diabetes outcomes using supervised machine learning models and uncover patient subgroups with clustering techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaned and visualized dataset, handled missing values using imputation.  
- **Supervised Learning:** Built and evaluated Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers. Compared models using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Applied K-Means clustering to group patients, achieving ~67% purity against labeled outcomes.
